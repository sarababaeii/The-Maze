# TheMaze
Solving an Arbitrary Maze

After compiling the code and running the executable file, enter the height and width of your maze, respectively. Then by considering wall cells as one and empty cells as 0, input your maze and wait for the answer.
The output will be a set of cells, creating a path between (0, 0) to (n-1, m-1) cells. If there were not such a path, it would print -1.
